# Three-Tier Application with Docker

This project demonstrates building a three-tier application consisting of a backend, database, and proxy using Docker principles. Below are the details and instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Features

- **Backend**: Utilizes a Dockerfile written with a multi-stage approach.
- **Database**: Credentials are securely stored on the host machine.
- **Proxy**: Runs over HTTPS with configuration files located on the host machine.
- **Networking**: Each container is isolated on a separate network.
- **Single Command Deployment**: The entire project can be brought up or down with one command.
